1
00:00:00,733 --> 00:00:01,899
in this animation

2
00:00:02,066 --> 00:00:03,533
we want to show the human

3
00:00:03,533 --> 00:00:06,733
immune system with images never seen before

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,100
we will learn how macrophages as well as

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,066
other cells and mechanisms

6
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:15,333
protect our organism from death every day

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:22,966
our skin

8
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:26,933
like the bulk of a tree represents valuable Protection

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:28,933
however

10
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:32,499
the skin is also home to countless microorganisms

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,900
among other things

12
00:00:33,966 --> 00:00:35,766
they are nourished and protected by an

13
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:37,966
oily fluid called sebum

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,066
sebum is produced by sebacious glands

15
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:47,899
sebum also contains antimicrobial elements

16
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,733
that can kill microbes

17
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,166
if they are harmful or too many microbes on the skin

18
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,566
the sebum is composed in such a way

19
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,666
that these microbes are killed

20
00:00:57,733 --> 00:01:00,566
this creates a harmonious coexistence between

21
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:02,399
skin cells and microbes

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,266
a kind of symbiosis

23
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:10,399
these myocropes also keep one another in balance

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,333
and kill pathogens that can be dangerous to our cells

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,933
the protective layer of hollow organs such as nose

26
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:24,333
mouth and trachea

27
00:01:24,366 --> 00:01:26,099
is a mucous membrane

28
00:01:31,266 --> 00:01:33,699
mucus membranes possess Celia

29
00:01:34,466 --> 00:01:37,333
Celia move back and forth in a wave like manner

30
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,399
this allows them to move mucus

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,733
to which foreign substances adhere

32
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:45,566
upward into the oral cavity

33
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:55,966
if you

34
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:58,466
concilier clearance is not sufficient

35
00:01:58,466 --> 00:01:59,166
and tamp

36
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:02,533
is made to achieve clearance of unwanted particles

37
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,933
through cuffing

38
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,299
this is done by inhalation

39
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,800
followed by a sudden exhalation

40
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:09,700
so that

41
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,566
foreign substances are removed from the lungs and

42
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:13,366
trachea

43
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:18,399
the bone mirror has stem cells

44
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:22,366
it is the birth place for many different immune cells

45
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:25,099
which we also call lucocytes

46
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,733
stem cells divided to form daughter cells

47
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:32,133
asymmetric or symmetric

48
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:35,166
symmetric cell division results in

49
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:38,733
either two stem cells or two progenitor cells

50
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:40,066
as seen here

51
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,966
the progenitor cells divide again and again

52
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,100
thus a single stem cell becomes many immune cells or

53
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:57,333
leukocides

54
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,100
a common immune cell is the neutrophil

55
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:05,499
some of the neutrophils remain in the bone merrow

56
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,766
while others make their way into the bloodstream

57
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:25,099
our neutrophyll belongs to the so called innate

58
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,400
immune system

59
00:03:26,766 --> 00:03:29,333
and moves through the blood vessels

60
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,933
during informatory processes

61
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:34,933
the endothelial cells of the blood vessels have

62
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:36,533
special receptors

63
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,666
thus initially there is weak adhesion than

64
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:40,999
strong adhesion

65
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,166
and finally

66
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:45,133
the granulocyte goes through the endothelium

67
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,133
this process is called diapedesis

68
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:53,333
the path

69
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,333
through the connective tissue has already been made by

70
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,566
other neutrophylls

71
00:03:57,566 --> 00:04:00,499
our neutrophyll only has to follow cycchines

72
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,933
that is signal substances of other cells

73
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:07,299
a process called Chemo Texas

74
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,100
there they are bacteria everywhere

75
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:26,566
they produce toxins and this

76
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,733
harm the cells of the organism

77
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:33,299
a neutrophil's job is to eat these bacteria

78
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,266
this eating process is called phagocytosis

79
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:42,099
in addition some of the neutralfuls produce

80
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,000
certain cytochines that attract other granulocides

81
00:04:57,566 --> 00:05:01,699
cells of the innate immune system or macrophages

82
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:07,366
they arrive on the scene before neutrophils

83
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,500
fagazytose bacteria and produce a signal substance

84
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:13,766
tumor necrosis vector

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,366
it suppresses the feeling of hunger causes fever

86
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:19,733
stimulates leukocyte production

87
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:25,366
another leukocyte type is the t cell

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,100
t cells possess receptors

89
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,933
what do they need them for

90
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:34,599
microphages or professional antigen presenting cells

91
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:37,199
they have the ability to present antigens via

92
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,466
certain proteins on their surface

93
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,899
and this initiates certain processes

94
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,866
some t cells can use

95
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:47,466
their receptors to recognize exactly those

96
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:49,399
antigens of the macrophages

97
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:51,166
for which they have been trained

98
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,499
in the thymes

99
00:06:01,566 --> 00:06:03,999
let us take a closer look at this

100
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,100
t cells are also formed in the bone marrow

101
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,866
they then migrate via the bloodstream to the thymus

102
00:06:12,266 --> 00:06:14,366
good they mature on the thymus

103
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,933
they are called t for thymus cells

104
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,566
in the thymus

105
00:06:19,566 --> 00:06:21,999
which is one of the primary lymphoid organs

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,466
t cells form antigen receptors

107
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:26,933
afterwards

108
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:30,133
they usually migrate two secondary lymphoid organs

109
00:06:30,366 --> 00:06:33,166
such as the lymph notes and the spleen

110
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,866
on the lymphoid organs

111
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:44,166
naive t cells and endritic cells meet

112
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,266
the endritic cells have already

113
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:48,133
had contact with a pathogen

114
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:50,966
and present the antigen on the surface

115
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:55,699
they are also professional antigen presenting cells

116
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:56,866
the t cell

117
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:59,466
scans the endritic cell for the antigen for which

118
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:00,866
the t cell was trained

119
00:07:00,866 --> 00:07:01,999
in the thymus

120
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:04,333
if it finds the antigen

121
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,766
diesel activation begins and among other things

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,566
colonal expansion occurs

123
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:19,699
this cell reproduces itself thousands of times

124
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:23,999
these cells respond to a specific pathogen or antigen

125
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:31,933
then

126
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:34,799
some t cells stored their journey and migrate to other

127
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,933
tissues once there

128
00:07:37,266 --> 00:07:39,599
the cytotoxic t cells scan other

129
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,333
cells with their receptors to look for cells

130
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:45,366
that have the specific antigen on the surface

131
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,300
if they find their antigen in a cell

132
00:07:56,466 --> 00:08:00,299
they know that a pathogen for example is in the cell

133
00:08:00,366 --> 00:08:04,499
the cytotoxic t cells begin to induce apoptosis

134
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,500
the cells debris are eventually eaten by mecrophagesis

135
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,933
and new cells form

136
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:51,399
there are not only cytotoxic t cells but others as well

137
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,166
tea helper cells

138
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:57,266
memory t cells regulatory t cells and others

139
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,400
t helper cells work hand in hand with B cells

140
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:09,533
b cells possess receptors like t cells

141
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:13,299
like t cells b cells also originate in the bone marrow

142
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,200
they then search for their specific antigen in the

143
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,333
lymphetic system

144
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,100
or in the bloodstream

145
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,600
if the B cell finds its antigen with its receptors

146
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,933
either activation occurs immediately

147
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,666
or the B cell moves into the lymphoid tissue where

148
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,266
t haper cells wait

149
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:38,999
teahubber cells as we have seen before

150
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:42,333
we're also trained for one specific antigen

151
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,666
for this reason

152
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:47,966
the B cell presents its antigen on the surface

153
00:09:48,866 --> 00:09:50,566
this allows the t cell

154
00:09:50,566 --> 00:09:53,199
with its receptors to scan the B cell

155
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:00,933
what is the antigen

156
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,099
for which the t cell has been trained

157
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:05,966
it gives the starting signal for the division

158
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:07,133
and maturation

159
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:08,166
of the B cell

160
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:22,366
as with t cells colonal expansion occurs

161
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:26,466
thus thousands of new B cells or plasma blasts

162
00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:30,066
and plasma cells are generated from a single B cell

163
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:37,766
memory b cells are also produced

164
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,933
which will spring into action in the event of another

165
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,500
subsequent infection

166
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,733
during acute infection

167
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,666
plasma blasts and plasma cells

168
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:50,766
immediately begin to produce antibodies

169
00:10:50,966 --> 00:10:55,399
and they release these antibodies into the bloodstream

170
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:59,566
antibodies are also often called immunoglobulence

171
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:19,799
at the toxin the bacterium the antigen is in the blood

172
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,600
the antibody just produced by the plasma

173
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,333
cell combined to it

174
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:26,299
in this way for example

175
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,500
a toxin can be rendered harmless

176
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,400
and an antigen can be mocked so that

177
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,566
macrophages can recognize it more

178
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,399
easily and fagurtize it more quickly

179
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,066
this process is called obsonization

180
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:47,366
all immune cells have as stem cell as their origin

181
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:49,166
it develops into progenitor

182
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,666
cells and eventually into the immune cells

183
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:52,666
just tune

184
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:56,166
other important immune cells on natural killer cells

185
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,299
and platelets

186
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,466
platelets also known as thrombusites

187
00:12:03,466 --> 00:12:07,333
originate in the bone marrow from mega carriocytes

188
00:12:07,766 --> 00:12:11,366
mega carriocytes have pseudopodia that extend

189
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:13,733
into blood vessels of the bone merrow

190
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,366
it is through these pseudopodia

191
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,533
that platelets are emitted into circulation

192
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,866
one mega carrier side

193
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,900
can produce 1000 to 3000 platelets

194
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:31,133
this process is called thrombopoesis

195
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,866
the platelets move through the blood

196
00:12:41,866 --> 00:12:43,266
vessels of the body

197
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:46,766
injury to your blood vessel occurs

198
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,600
hemostasis begins

199
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:51,999
the platelets adhere first

200
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,066
to the collagen fibers of the connective tissue

201
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:57,533
and eventually adhere to one another

202
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,333
this results in a quiet fretch ire platelet plug

203
00:13:13,466 --> 00:13:15,733
which prevents the blood from escaping

204
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:25,966
eventually fiber and strands form on the platelets

205
00:13:25,966 --> 00:13:28,266
which ensures a stronger plug

206
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,533
and it will bind more platelets and red blood cells

207
00:13:33,266 --> 00:13:36,266
thus a strong clot is formed
